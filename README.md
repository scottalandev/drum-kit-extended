# drum-kit-extended

A web-based drum kit with adjustable-tempo looping bass drum.

## Project Info

This drum kit project was started as a set of lessons in Angela Yu's [The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy. I extended the project with some added capabilities, most notably the addition of a looping bass feature. This added functionality allows the user to select a tempo in Beats/Minute with an html range input slider and then hold space bar to repeat the bass drum sound at the chosen tempo.
